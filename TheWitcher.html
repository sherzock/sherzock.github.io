							<p>The project was done by a group of thirty people for a university subject. The idea of the idea of the project was that we were given a genre and a theme and we had to build a game from with that, to do so we had to build our own game engine too in order to make the game. 
                                After 4 months of work we got to ship this hack n'slash tribute game based on the Witcher tv series. During the project I was assigned to the programmers team, so in order to start working on the game itself the first 2 months of the project were spent making the game engine while the designer's team and the artist's team were working
                            on the concept of the game. Once we had that working several people including me were assigned to help with the creation of the game itself, so for the second half of the production I was assigned to the QA team and the audio team where I got to work on making the audio and music for the game work.</p>
                            <p>Throughout the project I learned a lot about audio systems and about Wwise, how to implement it, how to make it work from the scripting module of the engine and how to work with Wwise projects. Also I learned a lot about how to deal with big projects and working with big teams of people.</p>
