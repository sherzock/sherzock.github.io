							<p>This Project was made for a game jam by a group of 5 people. The game jam was the 2nd edition of the Grand Citm Game Jam. We were given about 30 hours to make agame with the given theme and one of the subthemes we were given. The theme was the sea and the subtheme we chose was depths.
                            From there we chose to make an arcade like game were you had to control a submarine and defend yourself from  other submarines and  torpedos. I think it's important to say that before that game jam no one in my team had used Unity or any other game engine, so it was challenging for us as we
                            had to learn how to use an engine like unity for the first time and also ship a game in 30 hours.
                            </p>
                            <p>At the end we were pretty happy with the result as we were rookies with that type of projects.</p>
