							<p>Fantasy Brawl is a pseudo battle royale game where you get to fight 3 other players. The project wass don by a team of 8 people for a university project. The game was developed in c++ using SDL. Most of the art used 
                            was taken from the game final fantay tactics and the other part done by us. This project was great for me to develop a sense of what was like to work in a multidisciplinary team were there were designers, programmers and artists
                            and got a glance on how to handle projects like that. In the team my job was as a programmer and also as a designer with the rest of the team. The project took place in a 4 month period from february until late may 2019.
