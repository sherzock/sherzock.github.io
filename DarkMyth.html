							<p> Dark Myth is a Level Blockout and Level concept made from a One Page Dungeon. The project was made by two students as a deliverable for a Level design subject for university. The idea of the level was made for an rpg game such as a Souls like game.
                                We are currrently working on the third and last iteration of the level. 
                            </p>
                            <p>As we chose this One Page Dungeon as base we saw that what we had to do was a dungeon and cave like map, and as both me and my teammate really liked souls like game we chose to design the level for an rpg like game. Immediatly from there we thought about
                                taking references from big games such as Dark souls, Sekiro, Nioh or Skyrim. We thought that those games resembled what we were looking for to do, so we created several moodboards from there. After that we took a look at the orginal concept of the dungeon and the
                                the lore that the original author had created for the level, and we thought what was the best way of implementing the what we had given into a game expirience. After we had this clarified, we started with the first iteration of the level were we played with spaces and 
                                how this would affect the player when playing. After that iteration we had a basic concept of the level with all the spaces defined as they should be. On the second iteration we played more with lighting and player guidiance, and we also had to remake a part of the level
                                which was a bit confusing and really boring when playing. And now for the third iteration we are trying to make a really polished concept where we have all assets and sturctures polished.
