							<p> This project was made by a gorup of 5 students for the third edition of the Grand Citm Game Jam where the theme was Women in STEM. The game is a puzzle game were you get to be a scientist woman who has tho go through a lab saving all her coworkers who have been
                                infected by a very contagious virus, to do so she has to use and combine different potions left in the rooms of each level.
                            </p>
                            <p>As this was the third time I got to participate on a game jam, It felt much smoother and enjopyable expirience for me, I had more idea on how to plan the project and which were the important things we had to take into consideration when creating the project, also having worked several times on
                                with my other teamates made it a lot easier as we knew how each of us worked and communication was great between us. For the project I got to work as a game designer and a level designer, as well as a programmer.
