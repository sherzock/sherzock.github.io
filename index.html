							<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
							<p>Hello, my name is Jacobo Galofre and I am currently a student of the Video game development and design bachelor's degree at the CITM-UPC university in Barcelona. Throughout this four years I've been studying in this degree I've found that my passion and where I want to
							forge my future is In the video game Industry. I am currently willing to find somewhere where I can start and develop my career as a game developer or a game engine programmer.</p>
							<p>A part from my professional ambitions I really enjoy spending my time in the nature, discovering new music and of course playing some games with my friends.</p>
							<p>If you are Interested in knowing more about me and my work you can download my curriculum vitae or read about the projects I've worked on which are documented further down on this page.</p>

									<h3>Programming and QA</h3>
									<p>Throughout my student career I've worked on several projects where I developed my programming skills, I've mainly programmed on c/c++/c# but I have also learned and played with other programming languages such as lua, glsl, python, matlab, and others. I've worked with several IDEs and tools such as visual studio 2019 and code, Unity, UE4, etc. </p>

									<h3>Game Design</h3>
									<p>Since I started studying to become a game developer one of the things that most attracted me was the idea of creating amazing expiriences for people to play, and throughout this 4 years I've had the pleasure to learn about game design and improve my skills in several projects I've worked on. Although I know I'm still at the beginning of a long journey I seek to keep improving and mastering my skills as a game designer.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-hashtag"></span>
									<h3>Social</h3>
									<p>One of the most importannt skills I got to work on and improve are my social skills. Since day one when I started the degree, I learned that communication skills are crucial when working with a team. That's why during the degree I've done lots of projects where I had to work as a team with other collegues and that pushed me to improve on this aspect. A part from that I also have learned and used agile methodologies like scrum or kanban.</p>

								<h2>Andro Dunos Remake</h2>
								<p>This project was an Andro Dunos recreation tribute to the original side-scrolling shoot'em up game, purely developed in C++ with SDL by five students on our first year. With the possibilities of both playing it as a single player or cooperative game, the players take the control of a spaceship that faces different threats and a final boss that has to overcome in order to achieve victory. </p>
								<p>As it was a recreation of the game most of the work I did for the project was to document all the improtant information from the original game and also program the game systems and gameplay needed.</p>

								<h2>Torpedo Inbound</h2>
								<p>Torpedo Inbound is a Game Jam project made by 5 students during the 2nd CITM Game Jam.

								<h2>Fantasy Brawl</h2>

Each player is in control of a totally different hero each with its own characteristics and special ability.

								<h2>Dark Myth</h2>
								<p>Dark Myth is a prototype of a level similar to Dark Souls or Nioh game levels fully recreated in Unreal Engine from a One Page Dungeon called “Do it for the Beast”. It was fully developed with all the knowledge acquired on player guidance and level design to achieve a believable world while being challenging for the player and as a released game level. This project was developed by a teammate and me, thinking on the design of the rooms and the different zones in the level, by maintaining the lore of the one page dungeon.</p>
