							<p>The project was done by a group of five people for a university subject. The objective of the project was to make a tribute recreation of the classic shoot'em up game 
                                Andro Dunos, and to do so we ripped the art from the original game using Winkawaks emulator and recreated the game using C++ with SDL. Most of the work we did consisted 
                                on studying how the whole game worked and trying to recreate it by coding. Although my orginal role on the team was as a Designer at the end of the project we saw that the only role
                                needed in the team was as a programmer and QA, and it was on what I worked for the second part of the project.</p>
                            <p>We didn't recreate the whole project but just some of the levels of the original game.</p>
                            <p>If you want to know more about the project you can visit the website.</p>
